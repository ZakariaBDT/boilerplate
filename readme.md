It creates a new plugin with a simply dummy cusotm gutenberg block
and a custom block category. The name of the dummy block is **Bootsrap Block** and you will find it under **BOILERPLATE** cateogry.

Now, it is time to run the following command to install npm, simply run the following command in this boilerplate folder (You may rename the folder as per your need).

```
$ npm install
```

As a result, node_modules will be loaded and you can start developing your own block. To start editing & watching the effect, run the following command.

```
$ npm start
```

For production of your project, you have to build the whole project. So, to build the project, run the following command-
